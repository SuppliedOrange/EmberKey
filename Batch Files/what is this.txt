)> Installers:

    In ./installers you should find batch files that will automatically install the requirements.txt file for you.
    However, I don't know how many versions of python you have on your system or what their syntax is, so try them all until one of them work.
    installer1, installer2, installer3 respectively use python, python3 and py as their extensions.
    P.S Some installations will fail. That's okay, it depends on your Python version.

)> Fix broken app:

    Is your app not starting or crashing, but was working before? It might be a JSON error. You can try resetting all of your data to fix it. Run fix_app.py to fix it.
    Make sure you try all extensions, run any of the following
    py fix_app.py
    python3 fix_app.py
    python fix_app.py
    
    And empty config.json should have these defaults:
    {"theme": "reddit", "hotkeys": [], "addProcessData": [], "defaultFont": "Bahnschrift", "warnNoSound": false}
