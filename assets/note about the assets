we use yay.gif for playing the success message after updating theme

we use incorrectsound.mp3 for telling the user that their audio file path is invalid.

we use addHotKeyAnim.gif and removeHotKeyAnim.gif in the hotkey editor page.

walk.gif and fingerspin.gif were two of the gifs that i used alongside yay.giif originally. we can (maybe?) include those too through a setting, we'll randomly play one.

also, if we do switch to this project from the game, we need custom sprites and custom icons. the custom icon is priority.
